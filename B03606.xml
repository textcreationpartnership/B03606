            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:175683:3"/>Earth-quake happeneth when Air and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Spirits be ſhut up within the Caverns of the Earth, or have ſuch paſſage as is too narrow for them, they then ſtriving to break their Priſons, ſhake it, and make it tremble. Now this Impriſonment is cauſed thus, Namly, when the Earth which is dry by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happeneth to be Watered by continual Rains. Then not only the Pores and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns thereof are ſtopped and cloſed up, but the Exhalations and Air within the Earth are increaſed. To which purpoſe <hi>Dr. Fulk</hi> in his third Book of Meteors ſaith, The great Caves and Dens of the Earth, moſt needs be full of Air continually, for there is no <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in Nature, for when by the heat of the Sun, the moiſture of the Earth is reſolved, many Exhalations are generated, as well within the Earth as without; And whereas the places were full before, ſo that they could hold or receave no more, except part of that which is in them be let out, it moſt needs follow, that in ſuch Countrey, where the Earth hath few Pores, or elſe where the Ait ſtopped with Moiſture, that there I ſay, theſe Exhalations ſtriving to get out, do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rent the Earth or lift it up, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, a free paſſage may be had, or elſe room enough to abid therein, &amp; as in other kinds, ſo, alſo in this Subterranean fires multiply: Neither do we think that the Sun
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175683:4"/>is the only cauſe of ſhuting up of the Pores of the ground, for then Earth quakes ſhould be in a manner, as frequent as dryings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rain.</p>
            <p>The kinds of Earth-quakes be various, ſome when the whole force of the Wind driveth to one part: there being no contrary motion to let or hinder it, many Hills and Buildings, have been ruſhed down by that kind of Earth-quake, eſpecialiy when the Wind cauſing it be ſtrong, for if it be a feeble Wind, it only looſeneth or unfaſteneth foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: If leſs-feeble, then the Earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further hand ſhakes like one ſick of an Ague.</p>
            <p>The ſecond kind of Earth-quake, is not ſo much Lateral, as <hi>Perpendicular</hi> or upright, which is when the Earth with ſo great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence riſeth up by &amp; by ſinketh down again, for after the Wind that cauſeth the Earth to ſwell is broke out of Priſon, the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to its old place, even as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The Third is a Gaping, or Rending, or Cleaving of the Earth, one part being driven ſo farr from another, that whole Towns, Cities, Hills and Rocks, Rivers, Seas, and the like, are ſwallowed up, and never ſeen again. The Fourth, is a ſhaking, that cauſeth a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is farr differing from the former,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:175683:4"/>for now the Earth ſplitteth not, but ſinketh; This being in ſuch places, where the ſurface of the ground be ſolid, yet it hath a ſalt foundation, which being moiſtned with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the ſorce of the ſtinking exhalation, is turned into water alſo: Thus was the Antlantlck Ocean cauſed to be an Sea, which before was an Iſland, according to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Famous <hi>Plato</hi> 366 years before the Birth of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The fifth kind of Earth-quake, is contrary to the former, for as before the ground ſinks downſo now it's caſt up, like as in the ſecond kind already mentioned only this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that now the Earth returneth not into its place again, but remaineth a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yea, if ſuch a riſing be in the Sea, it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſeth overflowings, but produceth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many Iſlands, ſuch as was never ſeen before.</p>
            <p>Thus abſolutely have we conſidered the Caſe; Now relatively of the Antecedents of an Earthquake. A great Calmneſs of the Air mixed with ſome Cold; the reaſon of which is, becauſe the Exhalation which ſhould be blown abroad, is within the Earth. <hi>2ly.</hi> The Sun looks very dim certain dayes before there be no Clouds. The reaſon of which is, becauſe the Wind which ſhould have purged and diſſolyed the groſs Air, takes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175683:5"/>taken priſoner, and encloſed within the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Birds fly not, but ſitt ſtill beyond ordinary, thô there be no Clouds; The reaſon of which is, either the <hi>Pent</hi> Exhalation ſendeth ſome ſtrange alteration into the Air, which ſlenderly breath out of ſome inſenſible Pores of the Earth, which it may do, thô the Exhalation comes not out; or elſe it is that they are ſcarce able to fly for want of ſome gentle Gales for their Wings to ſtrike upon, It being a thing well known, that Birds fly more willingly and chearfully when the Air is of ſuch a temper. <hi>4ly.</hi> The weather is calme, and yet the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sea is troubled, and rageth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily: The reaſon of which is, becauſe the great plenty of ſpirits or wind in the bottim of the Sea, beginneth to lay out for paſſage that way, and finding none, is ſent back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whereupon, ſoon after it ſhaketh the Land, this is a certain ſign. <hi>5ly.</hi> The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the bottom of the Pits and deep Wells is troubled, aſcending and moving as if it boyled, ſtinking, and is infected: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, becauſe the Exhalation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pentin; and ſtriving to get forth, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome ſtinking minerals, and other Poyſonous Stuff to the ſprings of thoſe waters and they with the ſtrugling Exhalation, ſtir and attaint them. <hi>6ly.</hi> There is a long
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175683:5"/>thin Cloud ſeen in the clear Sky either a little before Sun ſetting, or ſoon after. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in a quiet Sea, the waves float to their Shore 'long and ſtraight. <hi>7ly.</hi> There is another infallible ſign, the great noiſe and ſound heard under the Earth, like to a groaning or very Thundering, this noiſe being made by the ſtrugling of the Wind under the Earth. Hence followeth the ſad effects, the firſt whereof is the ruine of Buildings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Death of many People. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet</hi> in his Chroniele ſaith, about the year 29, before the Birth of CHRIST, was an Earth-quake in <hi>Jury,</hi> whereby thirty thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and People periſhed. In the 5th year of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> Empercur of <hi>Rome,</hi> 13 Cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> were deſtroyed in one night by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. In the 66 year of CHRIST, three Cities of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were overthrown. And near <hi>Herapolis, Coloſſe</hi> a little after <hi>Pauls</hi> Death, their Church and Clergy degenerating, ſome by open Prophanity, ſome by horrid Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy commencing wickedneſs in CHRISTS Name. In the year of CHRIST 79, three Cities of <hi>Cyprus</hi> came to the like ruine, and in the year following there was a Death of many People at <hi>Rome.</hi> In the year 114 <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titoch</hi> was much damnaged, the Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> eſcaping very narrowly. About the year of CHRIST 181, the City <hi>Smyrna</hi> came to the like tuine. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
